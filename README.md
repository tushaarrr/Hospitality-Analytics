Hospitality Revenue and Booking Analysis
Overview

This project focuses on analyzing large-scale hospitality booking data to uncover revenue trends, platform performance, and customer behavior patterns. The goal was to transform raw booking records into clear, actionable insights that support business and financial decision-making.

The analysis emphasizes data accuracy, KPI-driven insights, and executive-ready dashboards, similar to real-world analytics work in consulting and business intelligence teams.
